    "summary": "On August 22, 2025, Iryna Zarutska—23 years old, Ukrainian refugee, survivor of war—was murdered on a Charlotte transit train. She had fled Russian bombardment only to be killed by a system where judicial officials repeatedly chose progressive ideology over public safety.",

    "analysis": "Her killer, Decarlos Brown Jr., had fourteen prior arrests spanning over a decade of violent crimes. Fourteen red flags ignored. Fourteen opportunities for judges to protect the public. This wasn't random violence—this was the predictable result of judicial negligence enabled by a criminal justice philosophy that treats public safety as secondary to criminal rehabilitation.",

    "keyFinding": "Let's name names. Because when judges enable murder, they should face the same scrutiny as any other professional whose negligence kills innocent people."
