        <h1 class="article-title">Fourteen Arrests: How Judicial Negligence Armed Iryna's Killer</h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle">When Judges Face No Consequences, Innocent People Die</p>
    </div>

    <div class="victim-tribute">
        <h3>In Memory of Iryna Zarutska</h3>
        <p>23 years old • Ukrainian refugee • War survivor • Dreamed of becoming a veterinary assistant<br>
        Killed August 22, 2025 • Charlotte, NC</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>On August 22, 2025, Iryna Zarutska—23 years old, Ukrainian refugee, survivor of war—was murdered on a Charlotte transit train. She had fled Russian bombardment only to be killed by a system where judicial officials repeatedly chose progressive ideology over public safety.</p>

        <p>Her killer, Decarlos Brown Jr., had <span class="emphasis">fourteen prior arrests</span> spanning over a decade of violent crimes. Fourteen red flags ignored. Fourteen opportunities for judges to protect the public. This wasn't random violence—this was the <span class="emphasis">predictable result of judicial negligence</span> enabled by a criminal justice philosophy that treats public safety as secondary to criminal rehabilitation.</p>

        <h2>The Judicial Officials Who Failed</h2>

        <p>Let's name names. Because when judges enable murder, they should face the same scrutiny as any other professional whose negligence kills innocent people.</p>

        <div class="judge-profile">
            <h4><span class="judge-name">Magistrate Teresa Stokes</span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>January 19, 2025:</strong> Released Brown on "written promise to appear" after arrest for misusing 911 services</li>
                <li><strong>Criminal History Available:</strong> Complete access to Brown's 14-arrest violent history</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Health Status Known:</strong> Documented schizophrenia with paranoid delusions about government implants</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Standard pretrial release protocols applied despite obvious danger</li>
                <li><strong>Consequences Faced:</strong> None</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="judge-profile">
            <h4><span class="judge-name">Chief District Judge Roy Wiggins</span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>July 28, 2025:</strong> Ordered competency evaluation for Brown</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation Timeline:</strong> Eight months of "procedural delays" while Brown remained free</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Murder Response:</strong> Same evaluation completed within days after Iryna's death</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Revealed:</strong> System can act urgently when it wants to</li>
                <li><strong>Consequences Faced:</strong> None</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>But Stokes and Wiggins represent just the tip of the iceberg. Brown's 14-arrest history necessarily involved <span class="emphasis">numerous unnamed judges and magistrates</span> making release decisions over more than a decade. Each decision followed the same pattern: <span class="emphasis">prioritize progressive criminal justice ideology over public protection</span>.</p>

        <h2>The Deadly Timeline That Exposes the System</h2>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <h4>Before the Murder (January-August 2025):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Brown released by Stokes despite violent history and mental illness</li>
                <li>Competency evaluation ordered by Wiggins but never completed</li>
                <li>Eight months of "procedural delays" and bureaucratic excuses</li>
                <li>System moves at glacial pace when public safety is at stake</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <h4>After the Murder (September 2025):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediate transfer to Central Regional Hospital-Butner</li>
                <li>Competency evaluation expedited and completed within days</li>
                <li>Federal charges filed with remarkable efficiency</li>
                <li>Sudden discovery of institutional urgency and resources</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p><span class="emphasis">The same system that couldn't evaluate Brown in eight months mobilized comprehensive resources within hours of his committing murder.</span> This timeline doesn't reveal bureaucratic inefficiency—it exposes deliberate negligence disguised as due process.</p>

        <h2>The Ideology Behind the Failure</h2>

        <p>Every release decision followed the same progressive criminal justice philosophy: treat violent history as just one factor among many, prioritize avoiding "mass incarceration" over protecting innocent lives, and view judges as advocates for defendants rather than guardians of public safety.</p>

        <p>This ideology has deadly consequences. Countries that maintain traditional tough-on-crime policies for repeat violent offenders demonstrate that protecting public safety works:</p>

        <div class="stats-comparison">
            <div class="stat-box good">
                <div class="stat-number">0.68</div>
                <div class="stat-label">Poland<br>Homicides per 100,000<br>(Traditional Justice)</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-box bad">
                <div class="stat-number">6.3</div>
                <div class="stat-label">United States<br>Homicides per 100,000<br>(Progressive Justice)</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The United States suffers <span class="emphasis">nearly ten times higher homicide rates</span> than countries that prioritize public safety over progressive rehabilitation theories. The ideology kills, and Iryna paid the price.</p>

        <h2>Judicial Immunity: The Root Problem</h2>

        <p>Here lies the fundamental issue: <span class="emphasis">judges face zero consequences for decisions that get innocent people killed.</span> When Teresa Stokes released a violent schizophrenic despite obvious danger, when Roy Wiggins allowed eight months of delays while a dangerous man roamed free, when unnamed judges repeatedly chose ideology over safety—none faced professional review, public accountability, or career consequences.</p>

        <p>The principle should be simple: <span class="emphasis">You make a deadly mistake, you pay the price.</span></p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            <p>When an engineer makes a fatal error and a bridge collapses, they face criminal charges.<br>
            When a doctor's negligence kills a patient, they face prosecution and lose their license.<br>
            When a pilot's poor judgment crashes a plane, they face investigation and career destruction.<br>
            When judges whose poor judgment arms killers face... promotion and tenure.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This immunity system creates perverse incentives. Judges know they can apply progressive ideology without personal risk—if their decisions enable murder, they suffer no consequences while families like Iryna's pay the ultimate price.</p>

        <h3>The International Evidence</h3>

        <p>Consider the stark contrast between American progressive justice and international approaches that actually work:</p>

        <p><strong>Poland's System:</strong> Maintains traditional law-and-order policies for repeat violent offenders. Result: 0.68 homicides per 100,000 population.</p>

        <p><strong>American System:</strong> Prioritizes rehabilitation over public safety, treats judicial immunity as sacred. Result: 6.3 homicides per 100,000 population.</p>

        <p>The evidence is overwhelming: <span class="emphasis">judicial systems that prioritize public safety over progressive ideology save lives</span>. American experiments in judicial leniency are killing innocent people.</p>

        <h2>Real Reform: End the Immunity</h2>

        <p>Enough excuses. Enough bureaucratic deflection. Enough hiding behind "progressive reform" while innocent people die. Here's what real accountability looks like:</p>

        <div class="reform-demand">
            <h4>Personal Criminal Liability for Judges</h4>
            <p>When judges release violent repeat offenders who commit predictable crimes, they should face criminal charges for negligent endangerment. If doctors face prosecution for fatal negligence, so should judges. No exceptions for "following protocols" when those protocols ignore obvious danger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reform-demand">
            <h4>End Anonymous Decision-Making</h4>
            <p>Every release decision for violent repeat offenders must become public record with the judge's name attached. No more hiding behind case numbers and bureaucratic anonymity. Public officials making public safety decisions should face public scrutiny.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reform-demand">
            <h4>Mandatory Risk Assessment Completion</h4>
            <p>Require completion of mental health evaluations before any release of defendants with violent histories and psychiatric conditions. No exceptions for "procedural delays." If the system can complete evaluations in days after murders, it can do so beforehand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reform-demand">
            <h4>Career Consequences for Deadly Judgment</h4>
            <p>Implement review boards to examine judicial decisions that enable subsequent violent crimes. Poor judgment should end careers, not continue them. Judges who consistently prioritize ideology over public safety should find other professions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reform-demand">
            <h4>End Progressive Immunity</h4>
            <p>Stop allowing judges to hide behind "criminal justice reform" when their ideological decisions arm killers. Progressive theories that ignore public safety have failed catastrophically and must be abandoned.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Pattern of Institutional Protection</h2>

        <p>Brown's case reveals how the legal establishment protects its own while innocent citizens pay the price. Consider the institutional response:</p>

        <p><strong>Media Coverage:</strong> Focuses on Brown's mental illness rather than the judicial decisions that kept him free to kill.</p>

        <p><strong>Official Statements:</strong> Emphasize "following proper procedures" rather than questioning whether those procedures protect public safety.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Response:</strong> No calls for judicial review, no demands for accountability, no consequences for deadly decisions.</p>

        <p>This pattern reveals how the system circles the wagons to protect judicial immunity while families like Iryna's are left to grieve without justice.</p>

        <h2>International Comparisons Prove Better Ways Exist</h2>

        <p>American progressive justice advocates claim their approach represents enlightened policy. International evidence proves otherwise:</p>

        <p><strong>Japan:</strong> Maintains strict pre-trial detention for violent repeat offenders. Homicide rate: 0.26 per 100,000.</p>

        <p><strong>Singapore:</strong> Prioritizes public safety over rehabilitation theories. Homicide rate: 0.17 per 100,000.</p>

        <p><strong>South Korea:</strong> Traditional approach to violent crime. Homicide rate: 0.60 per 100,000.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the United States—with its progressive judicial philosophy and extensive judicial immunity—suffers homicide rates 10-37 times higher than these countries. <span class="emphasis">The evidence is clear: progressive justice kills.</span></p>

        <h2>Justice for Iryna Demands Action</h2>

        <p>Iryna Zarutska survived Russian artillery bombardment, rebuilt her life in America, worked at Zepeddie's Pizzeria while attending college, and dreamed of becoming a veterinary assistant. Her bright future was stolen by judicial officials who prioritized progressive ideology over her safety.</p>

        <p>She deserved better. She deserved a system that protected her rather than enabled her killer. She deserved judges who prioritized public safety over political correctness.</p>

        <div class="call-to-action">
            <h3>The Choice Is Clear</h3>
            <p>Hold judges accountable for deadly decisions, or watch them enable the next murder. End judicial immunity, or accept that progressive ideology matters more than innocent lives.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Justice for Iryna demands ending the judicial immunity that protects officials who arm killers. Until judges face real consequences for enabling foreseeable violence, more innocent people will die for progressive ideology disguised as justice.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis">The system that failed Iryna continues to operate today, making the same ideological decisions, protecting the same officials, and enabling the next tragedy.</span></p>

        <p>Countries that maintain traditional law-and-order approaches—like Poland with its 0.68 homicide rate—prove that protecting public safety works. American progressive experiments in judicial immunity and leniency have failed catastrophically, producing devastating homicide rates and enabling tragedies like Iryna's murder.</p>

        <p>How many more Irynas must die before we admit that judicial immunity enables murder? How many more families must suffer while judges face no consequences for deadly decisions?</p>

        <p><strong>The choice is clear: Hold judges accountable or watch them kill again.</strong></p>
