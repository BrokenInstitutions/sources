        <h1 class="article-title">Fourteen Arrests: How Judicial Negligence Armed Iryna's Killer</h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle">A comprehensive investigation into institutional failures that enabled preventable tragedy</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>On August 22, 2025, Iryna Zarutska—23 years old, Ukrainian refugee, survivor of war—was murdered on a Charlotte transit train. She had fled Russian bombardment only to be killed by judicial officials who repeatedly chose ideology over public safety.</p>

        <p>Her killer, Decarlos Brown Jr., had fourteen prior arrests spanning over a decade of violent crimes. Fourteen red flags ignored. Fourteen opportunities for judges to protect the public. This wasn't random violence—this was the predictable result of judicial negligence enabled by progressive criminal justice philosophy.</p>

        <h2>The Judicial Officials Who Failed</h2>

        <p>Records show that Magistrate Teresa Stokes made a pretrial release decision in January 2025 that has since come under scrutiny. In January 2025, she released Brown on a "written promise to appear" after his arrest for misusing 911 services. Court documents show she had complete access to his violent criminal history and knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia with documented paranoid delusions about government implants.</p>

        <p>Stokes followed standard pretrial release protocols. Critics argue that current guidelines may not adequately address cases involving repeat offenders with mental health conditions.</p>

        <p>District Judge Roy Wiggins ordered a competency evaluation in July 2025. Court records indicate the evaluation process experienced delays that extended for several months, leaving Brown free to kill. After Iryna's murder, Wiggins suddenly found the urgency to complete Brown's psychiatric assessment within days—raising questions about the efficiency of the evaluation process and whether expedited procedures could have been implemented earlier.</p>

        <h2>The System's Damning Timeline</h2>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <h4>Before the Murder (January-August 2025):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Brown released by Stokes on written promise</li>
                <li>Competency evaluation ordered by Wiggins, never completed</li>
                <li>Eight months of "procedural delays" while Brown remained free to kill</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <h4>After the Murder (September 2025):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediate transfer to psychiatric facility</li>
                <li>Evaluation expedited and completed within days</li>
                <li>Sudden discovery of institutional urgency</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The same system that couldn't evaluate Brown in eight months mobilized resources within hours of his committing murder. This timeline exposes judicial negligence disguised as due process.</p>

        <h2>The Ideology Behind the Failure</h2>

        <p>Every release decision followed the same progressive criminal justice philosophy: prioritize criminal rehabilitation over public protection, treat violent history as just one factor among many, and avoid "mass incarceration" at all costs. This ideology transforms judges from protectors of society into advocates for criminals.</p>

        <p>Brown served over five years for armed robbery, was released in 2020, then within months was arrested for assaulting his sister. Each subsequent arrest followed the same pattern: liberal judges applying soft-on-crime policies that treat repeat violence as a rehabilitation opportunity rather than a public safety threat.</p>

        <p>The results are deadly. Poland, which maintains traditional tough-on-crime policies for repeat violent offenders, has a homicide rate of 0.68 per 100,000. The United States, with its progressive approach, suffers 6.3 homicides per 100,000—nearly ten times higher. The ideology kills.</p>

        <h2>Real Reform: End the Immunity</h2>

        <div class="reform-list">
            <h4>Personal Criminal Liability for Judges:</h4>
            <p>When judges release violent repeat offenders who commit predictable crimes, they should face criminal charges for negligent endangerment. If doctors face prosecution for fatal negligence, so should judges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reform-list">
            <h4>Public Accountability:</h4>
            <p>Every release decision for violent repeat offenders must become public record with the judge's name attached. No more hiding behind case numbers and bureaucratic anonymity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reform-list">
            <h4>Mandatory Risk Assessment:</h4>
            <p>Require completion of mental health evaluations before any release of defendants with violent histories and psychiatric conditions. No exceptions for "procedural delays."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Justice for Iryna</h2>

        <p>Iryna Zarutska survived Russian artillery to build a new life in America—working at Zepeddie's Pizzeria, attending college, dreaming of becoming a veterinary assistant. Her bright future was stolen by judicial officials who prioritized progressive ideology over her safety.</p>

        <p>The judicial officials involved in these decisions operated within a system that prioritized progressive ideology over public safety considerations. The pattern of decisions throughout Brown's case history demonstrates how contemporary criminal justice philosophy treats public safety as secondary to avoiding "harsh" treatment of repeat violent offenders.</p>

        <p>Countries that maintain traditional law-and-order approaches—like Poland with its 0.68 homicide rate—prove that protecting public safety works. American progressive experiments in judicial leniency have failed catastrophically, producing a 6.3 homicide rate and enabling tragedies like Iryna's murder.</p>

        <p>Justice for Iryna demands ending the judicial immunity that protects officials who arm killers. Until judges face real consequences for enabling foreseeable violence, more innocent people will die for progressive ideology disguised as justice.</p>

        <p><strong>The choice is clear: hold judges accountable or watch them kill again.</strong></p>
