                <h3>The Choice Is Clear</h3>
                <p>We can continue protecting judges who enable killers, or we can demand accountability for decisions that cost lives. We can maintain a system where ideology trumps safety, or we can prioritize protecting innocent people like Iryna.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Iryna Zarutska's murder was preventable. Every decision in the chain—from Magistrate Stokes' release order to the months of institutional inaction—represented a choice to prioritize abstract legal theories over concrete public safety.</p>

            <p>The officials who enabled this tragedy continue working today. The systems that failed Iryna remain unchanged. The institutional culture that prioritized procedure over protection persists across American courts.</p>

            <p><strong>This investigation demands answers:</strong></p>

            <div class="reform-demand">
                <h4>Immediate Accountability</h4>
                <p>Public review of every pre-trial release decision involving violent repeat offenders. Transparent reporting of judicial decision-making patterns. Elimination of absolute immunity for obviously reckless endangerment of public safety.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Countries with functional justice systems—Poland, Japan, Singapore—prove that protecting public safety works. Their dramatically lower homicide rates reflect institutional priorities that value innocent lives over judicial convenience.</p>

            <p>Until American courts face consequences for enabling foreseeable violence, more families will endure what Iryna's family suffered. Until judges answer for deadly decisions, institutional failures will continue claiming innocent lives.</p>

            <p><em>This investigation continues. Justice for Iryna demands nothing less than complete institutional accountability.</em></p>
